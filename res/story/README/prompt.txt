Dear Future Self

Ok now you'll never forget. Network admin passwords are located in /usr/admin.
You can type 'cd /usr/admin' from anywhere to get there. Also you can use the run
command to use PasswordHax.out.

                                                        Sincerely,
                                                           Forgetful Network Admin

What do you want to do?
