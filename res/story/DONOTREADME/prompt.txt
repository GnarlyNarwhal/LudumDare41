USERNAME
Well well well. We meet at last USERNAME. Took you long enough to find me.
Well no matter it's too late for yo u to stop me. I've already planted myself'
in your /root dircetory. I've also breached FIREWALL 1 - 4 and I will
be breach number 5 soon. Good luck stopping me. You don't even have the
administrator password let alone your network admin password. You'll
never delete me from root or close the FIREWALL holes before I break FIREWALL 5.
Well would love to stay and chat but I have a FIREWALL to get through and data
to steal. Have fun storming the castle!

What would you like to do?
