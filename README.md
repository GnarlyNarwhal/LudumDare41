# Ludum Dare 41

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Must have [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html) installed
* NOTE: I run Java 9 so I cannot guarantee that it will work on earlier version, but I don't believe I've used anything preventing it from running on some older versions. Click [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html) to download Java 9.

Graphics driver must have support for OpenGL 3.3 Core or later

### What's this all about?
This project is my game for Ludum Dare 41. If you don't know what [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/about) is and you're into making games then definitely check it out [here](https://ldjam.com/about).

### So what's the game?
Well it was supposed to be a text adventure mixed with a 2d platformer and in a sense it does this. But the quality of everything is so low it barely counts. Anywyas more specifically you are the user of a computer and you find out you have a virus installed. You must navigate the computer and complete tasks to eventually remove the virus. Or atleast that was the plan. The game was super rushed and is extermely incomplete so feelsbadman.jpg.

### Can I play it?
Of course! Here's how:

Click [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZfXLrX6FJWgNJHq8kJkk93fpgG5ftSIA) to download the game. Once you've downloaded it extract the zip file and run the jar file.

Of course you can always download the source and compile it yourself. You are going to need [LWJGL 3](https://www.lwjgl.org/download). Make sure to include JOML under **Addons**
